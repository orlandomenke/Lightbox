Raw, unstructured bug reports from outside this repo's tooling — a person, or
an agent (ChatGPT, another assistant) that does not know `BUGS.md`'s
conventions. Land them here, not in `BUGS.md` directly.

**Why the separation.** `BUGS.md`'s checkboxes are derived, not typed:
`scripts/bugs.py sync` expects `evidence:` to name a real, existing test (or
the literal `manual`), ids to be unique across the whole file, a domain from
a fixed list, and a priority read off the severity × reach matrix. A report
written by something that has not read those rules will not follow them —
not out of carelessness, but because it cannot see `bugs.py` or the codemap
that would let it name a real test. An entry with a guessed evidence line is
worse than no entry: it either fails `bugs.py check` loudly, or — worse —
happens to resolve against an unrelated test and reports a bug fixed that
never was.

**Format: whatever the reporter can produce.** A sentence, a screenshot
description, a repro. No structure is enforced here on purpose — the cost of
writing a report should not be "learn this file's conventions first."

**Processing.** A Claude Code session periodically works through this file:
for each entry, it either
- turns it into a proper `BUGS.md` entry — a real id, a domain, a priority,
  and either a named regression test or `evidence: manual` if none can reach
  it headlessly — following the format documented at the top of `BUGS.md`;
- or, if the report does not describe a real defect (already fixed, not
  reproducible, out of scope), removes it and says why in the commit;
- or, if it is ambiguous enough to need a person, leaves it here with a note
  under **Needs a decision** below, rather than guessing.

Processed entries are deleted from this file — `INBOX.md` is a queue, not an
archive. The archive is `BUGS.md` itself.
